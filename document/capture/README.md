# Document modality

A document modality is conceptually similar to the face and fingerprint biometric modalities in a way where a template characteristic to the subject is extracted from an image. The difference is: instead of biometric characteristics being extracted from an image of a face or a fingerprint, a set of values of pre-defined identity fields is extracted from an image of a personal ID document.
