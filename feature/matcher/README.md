# How matching works

Calling feature module provides `MatchParams` in navigation arguments with a list of
either `FaceSample` or `FingerprintSample` and a query to load the candidates from the database.

Matching needs to compare the probes templates with all the candidates templates and return a list
of X candidates sorted descending by their higher comparison scores.

- Sample list is provided because the Capture flow can return more than one capture (depending on
  the configuration). Each probe has its own template.
- Each candidate have a guid and a list of samples.

What this means is that the number of comparisons will be:

```
p * c * cs
```

p - number of probes
c - number of candidates
cs - number of samples per candidate

Example: if the configuration say that each capture has 2 samples, and the database already has 3
people, 12 comparisons will be made (2 * 3 * 2).

## Sorting the comparison scores

For response, calling module expects a MatchResult with a list of a guid and confidence score pairs.
This means that no matter how many samples the candidate has, only the highest comparison score will
be return.

What is being done is during a comparison of probes against a candidate, only the highest score of
all is kept and added to the MatchResult.

Example:

```
probe1 x candidate1.sample1 = 0.7
probe1 x candidate1.sample2 = 0.6
probe2 x candidate1.sample1 = 0.8
probe2 x candidate1.sample2 = 0.1
```

The value 0.8 will be the one assigned to candidate1 MatchResult.

The reason behind returning `max` instead of `mean` is because there is a probability that the
person can take 2 photos but one of them is from the wrong person. Or that the other photo has no
one in there - the user moves the phone too fast. So thinking about that, both cases would drag
the `mean` down as (1 + 0) / 2 = 0.5.

# Concurrency

Because the process of matching can be expensive - it needs to match `n` probes against `f`
candidate faces - we tried to run it in parallel. That way, we can run multiple matching at the
same time. Also, since the list will be ordered later, we don't need to care about the order that
the results are returned as well.
