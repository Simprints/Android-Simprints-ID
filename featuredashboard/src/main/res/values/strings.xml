    <string name="logout_sync_decline_warning">! THIS IS EXAMPLE TEXT !\n\nData synchronization is crucial for the smooth operation of various systems, and it is important to maintain consistency across all platforms. Refusing to synchronize data without a valid reason can result in severe penalties, including financial fines, loss of privileges, and even legal action.\n\nFurthermore, non-compliance with data synchronization policies can also cause a ripple effect that negatively impacts other individuals or organizations that rely on the shared data. This can lead to disrupted operations, errors, and inaccuracies.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to ensure that data is synchronized in a timely manner, and any issues or concerns that arise must be addressed immediately. If you have a legitimate reason for not syncing your data, such as technical difficulties or legal constraints, it is important to document and communicate this reason to the appropriate parties.\nTo avoid penalties and maintain the integrity of your data, it is crucial to comply with data synchronization policies and take appropriate measures to ensure that your data is accurate and up-to-date.</string>
