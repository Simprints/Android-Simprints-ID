Gradlew doesn't support junit tests in dynamic features with references to the main modules,
they can be launched only from Android Studio. Because CI needs to be able to run tests from the console,
then our junit tests need to sit in the Android Tests package (unfortunately they will be slower).
Annotations are useful to run just a small set of android tests on local machines.

E.g @MediumTest
./gradlew fingerprint:connectedCheck  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.size=medium
