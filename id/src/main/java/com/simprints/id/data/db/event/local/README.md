# Troubleshooting Room db with events
The events db is room based and encrypted, so to explore the content of the db you need to created a db that is not encrypted:

* Uninstall SID (if it's installed)
* Go to `EventRoomDatabase.kt` and comment out `.openHelperFactory(factory)` 
* Install SID  
* Open the Database Inspector in Android studio and go to `dbevents/DbEvent`
  
Note: you can't access a db that was already encrypted with a password that was generated by SID  



# Second approach

The above method didn't work for me, the app was crashing and debug-db never decrypted my DB. I went another route: not
encrypting the DB at all.
* Comment `.openHelperFactory(factory)` inside `EventRoomDatabase`, so the DB is not encrypted
* Uncomment `debugImplementation 'com.amitshekhar.android:debug-db:1.0.6'` in `build.gradle`
* Install SID
* Access https://phone_ip:8080/ on your computer
