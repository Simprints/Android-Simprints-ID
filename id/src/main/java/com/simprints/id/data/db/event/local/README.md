# Troubleshooting Room db with events
The events db is room based and encrypted, so to explore the content of the db you need to created a db that is not encrypted:

* Uninstall SID (if it's installed)
* Go to `EventRoomDatabase.kt` and comment out `.openHelperFactory(factory)` 
* Install SID  
* Open the Database Inspector in Android studio and go to `dbevents/DbEvent`
  
Note: you can't access a db that was already encrypted with a password that was generated by SID
