# Troubleshooting Room db with events
The events db is room based and encrypted, so to explore the content of the db you need to created a db with a fixed password:

* Uninstall SID
* Set a fixed password in DbEventDatabaseProvider (e.g. `val key = "test".toCharArray()`)  
* Add the password in android.buildTypes.debug `resValue("string", "DB_PASSWORD_DBEVENTS", "test")`  
* Add `debugImplementation 'com.amitshekhar.android:debug-db:1.0.6'` and `debugImplementation 'com.amitshekhar.android:debug-db-encrypt:1.0.6'`  
* Install SID  
* Access the https://phone_ip:8080/  
  
Note: you can't access a db that was already encrypted with a password that was generated by SID  
  
The added library will create a web server showing the room data:

# Second approach

The above method didn't work for me, the app was crashing and debug-db never decrypted my DB. I went another route: not
encrypting the DB at all.
* Comment `.openHelperFactory(factory)` inside `EventRoomDatabase`, so the DB is not encrypted
* Uncomment `debugImplementation 'com.amitshekhar.android:debug-db:1.0.6'` in `build.gradle`
* Install SID
* Access https://phone_ip:8080/ on your computer
