    <string name="short_consent">I would like to use your fingerprints and location so Simprints can find your health records. If thatâ€™s not OK or you have any questions let me know, otherwise please place your left thumb flat on the sensor.</string>

        <b><u>Privacy and Consent</u></b>\n\n
        If you put your finger on the scanner, it will record information about your fingerprint. It will also record the approximate location where this scan took place, and the time and date of the scan. \n \n
        All this information of yours will be stored by Simprints Technology Limited, which is a British NGO. \n\n
        Simprints will use your information to help Possible identify you in the future, and match you to your medical records. As part of this, Simprints will share your fingerprint information with Possible. \n\n
        Simprints may also use your information to improve the accuracy of its service, and may share it with other experts for this purpose. \n\n
        Simprints may also use your information to get a better understanding of healthcare provision in Nepal. \n\n
        In the future, Simprints may also use your information to help other partner development organisations to identify you, and may share your information with those organisations for that purpose. \n\n
        Simprints expects that its work here in Nepal will last until at least 2019. Simprints will keep your information for the duration of its work here in Nepal, and for 2 years after that work has finished. Simprints will then delete your information. \n\n
        Simprints will not store any fingerprint images. \n\n
        Simprints will not give any information that it holds on you to any state, unless required to do so by law. \n\n

        If you have previously been happy for Simprints to store and use your information, but you have changed your mind and you do not want this to continue, then please speak to me. \n\n

        <b><u>Frequently asked Questions</u></b> \n\n
